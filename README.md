# ANOTHER WORLD INTERPRETER

This is a quick and dirty fork and port of the [Another World Bytecode Interpreter](https://github.com/fabiensanglard/Another-World-Bytecode-Interpreter) with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/), targeting Linux and [WASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

Under Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu, Mint, ...):

```
apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev zlib1g-dev
```

### Install the data files

The required game data files must be copied into the [src/assets](src/assets) directory.

### Build and run the project

```
cd src
make -f Makefile.linux
./another-world.bin
```

You can also run the provided build script:

```
./build.sh linux
```

## COMPILE AND RUN FOR WASM

### Install the dependencies

In order to build the WASM port, You must install the [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) toolchain.

  - [Download and install](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)

### Build and run the project

```
cd src
make -f Makefile.wasm
emrun ./another-world.html
```

You can also run the provided build script:

```
./build.sh wasm
```

## COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

  - `--datapath=PATH` location of the game assets (default `./assets`)
  - `--savepath=PATH` location of the game states (default `./assets`)

## GAME CONTROLS

  - `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right` move
  - `Space` or `Enter` run or fire
  - `Tab` change the window size
  - `c` enter a code to jump at a specific level
  - `p` pause the game
  - `Ctrl l` load game state
  - `Ctrl s` save game state
  - `Ctrl +` next game state slot
  - `Ctrl -` prev game state slot
  - `Ctrl x` exit the game
  - `Escape` exit the game
