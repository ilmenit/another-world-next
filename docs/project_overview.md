# Project Overview

## Introduction

The Another World Interpreter is a modern C++ reimplementation of Eric Chahi's groundbreaking 1991 game "Another World" (also known as "Out of This World" in North America). This project represents a complete reverse-engineering and modernization of the original game's virtual machine architecture.

## Project History

### Original Game (1991)
- **Creator**: Eric Chahi
- **Publisher**: Delphine Software

- **Innovation**: First game to use polygon-based character animation

### Reverse Engineering (2004)
- **Developer**: Gregory Montoir
- **Project**: RawGL (Raw Game Library)
- **Achievement**: Complete reverse-engineering of the virtual machine

### Modern Implementation (2010s)
- **Developer**: Fabien Sanglard
- **Focus**: Code cleanup and educational value
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical analysis

### Current Fork (2024-2025)
- **Developer**: Olivier Poncet
- **Goals**: Clean architecture, modern C++, cross-platform support
- **Platforms**: Linux, WebAssembly (WASM)

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Virtual Machine (VM)**
   - Custom bytecode interpreter
   - Multi-threaded execution model
   - 256 registers and stack-based operations
   - Cross-platform game logic execution

2. **Video System**
   - Polygon-based rendering engine
   - Page-based graphics system (4 pages)
   - 320x200 resolution, 4-bit color depth
   - Smooth scrolling and transitions

3. **Audio System**
   - Multi-channel sound mixing
   - Music and sound effect playback
   - Sample-based audio processing

4. **Resource Management**
   - Compressed game data loading
   - Dynamic resource allocation
   - Cross-platform data format support

5. **Backend Abstraction**
   - Platform-specific implementations
   - SDL2-based rendering and input
   - Timer and event management

### Key Technical Features

- **Bytecode Interpreter**: Custom virtual machine for cross-platform compatibility
- **Polygon Rendering**: Smooth character animation using vector graphics
- **Resource Compression**: Efficient data storage and loading
- **Multi-threading**: Concurrent game logic execution
- **Page-based Graphics**: Smooth scrolling and transitions

## Game Features

### Visual Innovation
- **Polygon Characters**: Smooth, fluid character animations
- **Cinematic Presentation**: Movie-like cutscenes and transitions
